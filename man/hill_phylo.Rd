\usage{
hill_phylo(
  comm,
  tree,
  q = 0,
  base = exp(1),
  rel_then_pool = TRUE,
  show_warning = TRUE,
  return_dt = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A data frame of vegetation data. Sites as rows, species as columns.}

\item{tree}{A phylogeny with class 'phylo'.}

\item{q}{Hill number, \code{q} = 0 (default) to get species richness,
\code{q} = 1 to get shannon entropy, \code{q} = 2 will give inverse Simpson.}

\item{base}{default is \code{exp(1)}, the base of log.}

\item{rel_then_pool}{default is \code{TRUE.} Abundance of species are first changed to relative abundance within sites,
then pooled into one assemblage. If \code{FALSE}, sites are pooled first, then change abundance of species
to relative abundance.}

\item{show_warning}{whether to print warning, default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{return_dt}{Whether to return the Phylogenetic Hill numbers Dt, default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A vector of hill number based phylogenetic diversity (`PD(T)`, effective total branch length) for all sites. If a site has less than 2 species in the final dataset, NA will be returned.
}
\description{
Calculate alpha phylogenetic diversity based on Hill numbers
}
\examples{
comm = dummy = FD::dummy$abun
tree = ape::rtree(n = ncol(comm), tip.label = paste0('sp', 1:8))
hill_phylo(comm, tree, q = 0)
hill_phylo(comm, tree, q = 0.999)
hill_phylo(comm, tree, q = 1)
hill_phylo(comm, tree, q = 2)
